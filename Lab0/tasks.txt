Task 6

------

Edited commit since the number of the task was wrong: git commit --amend -m "Adding Task 6"
Source for code: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/

For task 7: had to create a new directory utilizing the $ git clone

Command to look for: 
git log -S "--no-mouse"
And the no mouse command was at:

commit c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168
Author: Junegunn Choi <junegunn.c@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 30 15:41:44 2014 +0900

    Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED
But it took looking through a couple commands to see it.


Task 8: git diff
And git checkout


Task 9: touch mistake.txt
Git add mistake.txt
Git commit -m "New mistakes file"
Git push
, then used 
Git log and git revert 78d0248823df40dbc4875f5efc6af39e3706d429 to delete the file, but it kept going me an error.


Task 10:

'git add/rm <file>' error message that appeared when trying to create number 10.
