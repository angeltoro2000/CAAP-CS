Comments:
- Very neat code!
- all content should be in the <body>, nothing goes after it but the </html> tag.
- Consider changing your stylesheets so no content is blokced by other content or images. 
- Maybe adding more psace in the nav bar?
- Your profile needs more content
- You need to close all elements (except for very few like <img>), or you page can be very buggy. Fix your <ol> and <ul>
    --> The profile.html page has a lot of bugs
- Comment your code
